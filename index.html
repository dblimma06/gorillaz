                <h2>Murdoc</h2>
                <h3>Name: Murdoc Alphonce Niccals; Age: 59</h3>
                <p>He was born in 06/06/1966, Murdoc is the basist of the band and the leader of the band, During his childhood years, Murdoc attended Sodsworth Comprehensive School where he gained a reputation for his truancy, puerile pranks, ugliness, poor personal hygiene, and generally unruly behaviour. From the first day, he would frequently be found in the corridors during lessons and propping up walls outside of the classrooms, distracting the other pupils with "endless quacking noises and pointless, malicious humour". His form teacher, Mr Gravadlax, a man described by Murdoc as "turning up stinking of poppers", described Murdoc as "an appalling student" and "a stupid imbecile who often turned up smelling of whiskey". Although, even as a child, he had charisma, had a great knack for getting his acquaintances to see things "the Murdoc Niccals way" and certainly stood out. Despite all this, he was also the target of much bullying both from the pupils and the teachers. At age nine he was raped by a school lunch lady, which he cites as the source of his 'constant bad mood'. Murdoc was also bullied at school by a big, thick, meaty skinhead lump of a boy with arms like two racks of kabob meat named Tony Chopper. Chopper would call Murdoc all kinds of names and the list went on with new ones added daily. Murdoc got back at Tony by calling him a lot of offensive and extremely harsh names, ultimately calling him "a useless, bloated backward waste of space who would probably get a job of holding up 'For Sale' signs on the corner of streets only to then get himself fired and replaced by a bucket of the soil", which resulted in Tony punching Murdoc in the nose, breaking it. And he participate in the story of all the characters</p>

            <h2>2D</h2>
            <h3>Name: Stuart Harold Pot; Age: 47</h3>
            <p>He was born in 23/05/1978 One day, he hit his head when falling from a tree at the age of eleven, causing all of his hair to fall out. When it came back it was a deep 'azure blue'.</p>
            <p>On 15 August 1997, when Stuart was 19, his life changed forever after hooligan Murdoc Niccals, age 31, purposefully crashed his Vauxhall Astra through the wall of Uncle Norm's Organ Emporium, where Stuart had been working, in an attempt to ram-raid the store and steal the synthesizers. Murdoc's bumper crashed into Stuart's face, landing him with an 8-ball fracture also known as hyphema, although he could still see through his injured eye. Murdoc was arrested and sentenced to carry out 30,000 hours (1250 days) of community service as well as care for the incapacitated Stuart for 10 hours every week. One year later, in a poor attempt to impress some women, Murdoc performed a 360° spin in a Tesco car park in Nottingham with his vehicle. This sent Stuart crashing through the windscreen, hitting his head on the curb, and fracturing his other eye. When Stuart awoke after sliding through the cement for about a mile, he turned to look at Murdoc. This was the moment when Murdoc knew he had his frontman. "A blue-haired, black-eyed god", Murdoc called him. Murdoc nicknamed Stuart '2-D', which stands for the 'Two Dents'. Rather amusingly, Stuart adored his new nickname, dropping the use of his birth name completely and even signing formal letters with the first name "Two" and surname "D". 2-D would appear to have a chronic history of violent blows to the head, coupled with a complete lack of natural intelligence. Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett commented on this, saying that he has a blank sheet of paper where a brain should be. Despite this, he serves as Gorillaz's lead vocalist and songwriter for most of the band's albums.</p>
